## History of Hello World!

I want to share with you the history of "Hello World".

For almost everyone, the [first line of code](#history-of-hello-world) they learn is
```
System.out.print("Hello world!");
```

This line becomes a "tradition" of programming because of the influence of [*The C Programming Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History).
